                    <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>Hi, my name is Gourav Kadariya and I was born and raised in a small village called Jhiljhile from country Nepal. As for
                     my academic background, I completed BSc CS IT from Academia College located in Kathmandu, Nepal in the year 2019 and 
                     since then, I have worked as an IT support and Front-end developer. With the aim to learn and grow even more I choose Full Stack Software
                     Development to enhance my programming skills and build strong resume from Lambton College.
